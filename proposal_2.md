## Overview

`%wiki` as it exists today is capable of publishing wikis to the clearweb, and collaborating via EAuth. However as a decentralized network of wikis, `%wiki` has the potential to do much more, and this proposal for "%wiki phase 2" is meant to address that.

The overall aims of this grant are:

* Users can read other users' wikis by logging into their own ship, without needing the wiki host's public URL
* Global search, which can include results from all public wikis on the network
* Various UX enhancements
* Shared private wikis
* A user management system

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 - Public Remote Access + Global Search

* Estimated completion: March 1st 2024
* Compensation: 2 stars
* Deliverables
  * User can create and edit content on remote public wikis
    * User does not need to join or subscribe to a public wiki to access it
    * User does not need to know the wiki host's URL
    * Host does not need to make their wiki accessible via a URL
  * `%wiki` maintains an index of wikis from across the network
    * Index is decentralized, there is no central indexer ship
    * User does not need to proactively add these wikis to the index
    * Index is reasonably exhaustive, should track the entire network of public wikis
  * Global search - search results can include matches from all indexed wikis
    * Searching will return similar pages from different wikis, including wikis the user has not visited before

### Milestone 2 - User Experience Enhancements

* Estimated completion: April 2024
* Compensation: 1 star
* Deliverables:
  * Mobile-friendly UI
  * Host can use custom CSS for their wiki
  * Host can use a custom logo for their wiki
  * User can bookmark remote wikis
  * User can fork remote wikis
    * User becomes the host of the forked wiki
    * Forked wiki keeps the revision history of its parent wiki

### Milestone 3 - Shared Private Wikis + User Roles

* Estimated completion: May 2024
* Compensation: 2 stars
* Deliverables:
  * Hosts can assign roles to other users such as admin, moderator, and editor
    * Admins can do anything the host can
    * Hosts/admins can restrict editing to the "editor" role or higher
    * Hosts/admins/mods can ban specific users
  * Hosts of private wikis can grant access to other specific Urbit users
    * TBD if this is based off a whitelist or %groups membership
  * Users can access private wikis either at their clearweb URL via EAuth, or remotely via their own ships
